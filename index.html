	        	<h1>WHO I AM</h1>
				<p>I am Nickolas Zamachnoi, a communications technology student in grade 12 at the OCV. I'm super interested in learning what it takes to be a great photographer, video-creator, and graphic designer. I work hard and have been doing graphic design since I was 11 years old, and started monetizing it at 13.</p>
				<br>
				<h1>WHY I'M HERE</h1>
				<p>I grew up with a very talented and gifted family in terms of art, but for some reason I was never able to draw or paint. I wanted to be just like them, so I took up photography, video-creation and graphic design. I now love these 3 things as much as anything in the world, and use my skills which I have learned to help the people around me. I want to help my friends and family grow their hobbies and future life goals to make them look beautiful.</p>
				<br>
				<h1>WHERE I'M GOING</h1>
				<p>I love making YouTube videos, taking beautiful pictures, and making new and innovative graphic design. While this isn't my career path, being creative has been a part of me ever since I was young. I'm using the opportunity I have in high school to take communications technology for the second time to make my hobby more professional and more satisfying for me. The goal for me isn't to be the greatest ever, it is to create things I am proud of and to continue improving my skills.</p>
